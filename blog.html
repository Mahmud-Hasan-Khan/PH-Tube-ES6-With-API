                        or that a property or a function parameter does not exist. It is the default value for
                        uninitialized variables and missing parameters. It indicates an unintentional or unknown state
                        of the program</li>

                        <strong>Null</strong> means an empty value or a blank value. It is used to indicate a deliberate
                        or known absence of a value. It can also be used to clear or reset a variable that previously
                        had a value. The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of
                        JavaScript’s primitive values and is treated as false for boolean operations.

                        A <strong>REST API</strong>, or Representational State Transfer Application Programming
                        Interface, is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. It
                        is an architectural style for designing networked applications, particularly web services, that
                        rely on a stateless client-server communication model. REST APIs are widely used for building
                        distributed and scalable web applications.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform standard database functions like creating,
                        reading, updating, and deleting records (also known as CRUD) within a resource. For example, a
                        REST API would use a GET request to retrieve a record, a POST request to create one, a PUT
                        request to update a record, and a DELETE request to delete one. All HTTP methods can be used in
                        API calls.
                        <br><br>
                        The state of a resource at any particular instant, or timestamp, is known as the resource
                        representation. This information can be delivered to a client in virtually any format including
                        JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text. JSON is popular
                        because it’s readable by both humans and machines—and it is programming language-agnostic.
                        <br><br>
                        Request headers and parameters are also important in REST API calls because they include
                        important identifier information such as metadata, authorizations, uniform resource identifiers
                        (URIs), caching, cookies and more. Request headers and response headers, along with conventional
                        HTTP status codes, are used within well-designed REST APIs.
